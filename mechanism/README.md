## Bill of Materials

### Servo

Servo is the key component. I use TowerPro [MG92B](http://www.towerpro.com.tw/product/mg92b/). It has metal gear (important!).
An hexapod requires 18 of them.

Note.
The dimension of 3d printed part is highly depended on servo's dimension.
Modification is required if you want to use other alternative servo. 

Note. 
TowerPro MG92B can be found on Ebay seller [servohorns959](https://www.ebay.com/usr/servohorns959), which is listed on TowerPro official website ([Link](http://www.towerpro.com.tw/about-us-2/)). I also got mime servo from him.
